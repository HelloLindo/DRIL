# Dynamically Rule-Interposing Learning in Deep Reinforcement Learning

Here are the experiments of Dynamically Rule-Interposing Learning(DRIL) model.  

For more information, please click each folder and read the README.

## About DRIL  
The main idea is about proposing a method that combines both knowledge representation and DRL.
